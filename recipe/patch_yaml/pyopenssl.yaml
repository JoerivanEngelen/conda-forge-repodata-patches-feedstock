# The X509_V_FLAG_NOTIFY_POLICY constant was removed from cryptography in version 42.0.0.
# xref: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/9163
# This constant was used in pyopenssl versions prior to version 23.2.0.
# xref: https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/pull/1213
# pyopenssl versions prior to 22.0.0 did not have an upper bound on cryptograpy to exclude newer versions.
# Therefore, pyopenssl less than 23.2.0 is not compatible with cryptography greater than or equal to 42.0.0,
# but there is nothing preventing pyopenssl<22.0.0 being solved with later versions of cryptography.

# The above patch has the effect of encouraging the solver
# to prefer pyopenssl 21.0.0 instead of the latest version
# if there is a newer cryptography version available that is
# incompatible with all modern versions of pyopenssl. Thus
# we need to add upper bounds for all previous versions as
# well.
# The specific error I see with pyopenssl 21.0.0 and
# cryptography 44.0.0 is:
#   .pixi/envs/default/lib/python3.12/site-packages/OpenSSL/crypto.py:1598: in X509StoreFlags
#       NOTIFY_POLICY = _lib.X509_V_FLAG_NOTIFY_POLICY
#   E   AttributeError: module 'lib' has no attribute 'X509_V_FLAG_NOTIFY_POLICY'.
#       Did you mean: 'X509_V_FLAG_EXPLICIT_POLICY'?
